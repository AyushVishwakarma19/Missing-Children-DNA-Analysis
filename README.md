## DNA Profiling Data Analysis
Analyzing DNA matches to help identify missing children using structured profiling and data visualization.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on DNA profiling to identify missing children by analyzing genetic similarities. Using Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project provides insights into potential familial relationships based on genetic markers.

## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of synthetic DNA profile data with the following attributes:

ID - Unique identifier for each individual
Gender - Male/Female
Age - Age of the individual
Region - Geographical region
Parent_ID - Links parent-child relationships
Match_Score - Similarity score between DNA profiles
Status - Missing/Found
STR_1 to STR_5 - Short Tandem Repeat markers for DNA profiling

## Analysis & Visualizations
This project implements several key analyses using Python:

✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, formatting data
✔️ Distribution of DNA Matches by Relationship Type – Pie chart analysis
✔️ Age Distribution of Missing Children – Histogram visualization
✔️ Gender-Based Distribution of Missing Children – Pie chart
✔️ Geographical Distribution of Cases – Heatmaps and bar charts
✔️ STR Marker Distribution Analysis – Boxplots to compare genetic variations

## Technologies Used
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🔹 Jupyter Notebook
🔹 GitHub for version control

## How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory using:
cd Missing-Children-DNA-Analysis

Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook DNA PROFILING PROJ.ipynb

## Future Enhancements
✅ Add Power BI dashboards for better data visualization
✅ Incorporate machine learning to predict missing persons
✅ Develop an automated DNA match recommendation system
